#### About
Libft project of the [42 school](http://42.fr).

Please do not hesitate to add or enhance the current code to this library.
All modifications must respect the [42 norm](http://ncoden.fr/datas/42/norm.pdf)

The development method used is the [Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) : a function requires some arguments, and provides in exchange for return a valid result. It is **normal that the program crashes** if bad parameters are passed to a function. **It's the developer's job to ensure that he correctly uses the library**.

Some functions still contain argument checks, but the new features should not.
